I eat words for dinner, words for brikfist and sometimes I even write words.
I can be found sippin’ on words at the local coffee house or even wordin’ it up at the local watering hole.
I’m wordin’, I’m wordin’, I’m wordin’ it up… ch ch ch ch ch check it out.
Find me on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and elsewhere.
